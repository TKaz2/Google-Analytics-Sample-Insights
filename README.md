Showcasing the ability to write basic SQL queries on BigQuery.

Used a dataset from BigQuery's Google Analytics Sample to discover insights on customer purchases in the Google store.
The dataset is included in this repository.

Wrote code for two different queries to achieve two different goals:
 - Discover which products drove the most revenue
 - Discover which regions drove the most revenue, as well as the devices customers used to make these purchases

The first several query results are shown in the png files.
