Used a dataset from BigQuery's Google Analytics Sample to discover insights on customer purchases in the Google store.
The dataset is included in this repository.

Wrote code for two different queries to achieve two different goals:
 - Discover which products drove the most revenue
 - Discover which regions drove the most revenue, as well as the devices customers used to make these purchases

Attached to this repository are the SQL code for the queries used, as well as images that show the first several results of these queries.

Utilized my skills attained from the Google Data Analaytics certification to write these queries.
